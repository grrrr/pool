----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goals/features of the package:

- pool can store and retrieve key/value pairs, where a key can be any atom and 
	the value can be any list of atoms
- pool can manage folders. A folder name can be any atom.
- pool objects can be named and then share their data space
- clipboard operations are possible in a pool or among several pools
- file operations can load/save data from disk

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT INFORMATION for all PD users:

Put the pd-msvc/pool.dll, pd-linux/pool.pd_linux or pd-darwin/pool.pd_darwin file
into the extra folder of the PD installation, or use a -path or -lib option 
at PD startup to find the pool external.

Put the help-pool.pd file into the doc\5.reference subfolder of your PD installation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT INFORMATION for all Max/MSP users:

For Mac OSX put the max-osx/pool.mxd file into the folder 
/Library/Application Support/Cycling '74/externals

For Mac OS9 put the max-os9/pool.mxe file into the externals subfolder of your Max/MSP installation

For Windows put the max-msvc\pool.mxe file into the folder
C:\program files\common files\Cycling '74\externals (english version)

Put the pool.help file into the max-help folder.

BUILDING from source
--------------------

You will need the flext C++ layer for PD and Max/MSP externals to compile this.
See http://grrrr.org/ext/flext
Download, install and compile the package.
Afterwards you can proceed with building this external.


pd/Max - Windows - Microsoft Visual C, Borland C++, MinGW:
----------------------------------------------------------
Start a command shell with your eventual build environment
(e.g. run vcvars32.bat for Microsoft Visual Studio)

then run
 ..\flext\build.bat
(you would have to substitute ..\flext with the respective path to the flext package)


pd/Max - OSX/Linux - GCC:
-------------------------
From a shell run
bash ../flext/build.sh
(you would have to substitute ../flext with the respective path to the flext package)
